# Social Media Tracking

## Attempting to create a simple python tool to track follower counts across social media platforms

Temporary Solution will involve a scraping tool - Beautiful Soup along with Requests

Will move onto more difficult usage of code from API requests to utilise JSON which will be more concise and scalable

This will remove all concerns of changing UIs for the scraping tool in the future - thanks to Maxime for guidance

Integrating use of APIs from:
* Facebook
* Twitter
* Twitch
* Youtube
* Instagram

* Main stumbling block atm is requesting for access for Facebook APIs - they also own instagram.
* Youtube has a simple json and urllib request system that I used courtesy of HowCode
